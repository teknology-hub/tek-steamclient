/// Declarations of various structures describing content of Steam application
///    depots and their updates, and the API to work with them.
///
/// SteamPipe content servers store data organized into depots, you can read
///    more about them
///    [here](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/depots).
/// Depots host 3 known types of files:
///  Chunks - actual binary content of the application, no bigger than 1 MiB
///    each, although they are stored in an archive format (Zip, VZ or VSZ),
///    which may cause them to be slightly bigger if compression is ineffective
///    on them.
///    Application files are split into the chunks, which are identified by
///    SHA-1 hash of the data they contain, which allows them to be reused for
///    repetitive content and save both on server storage space and download
///    size, while also optimizing verification and updates.
///  Manifests - lists of all files and directories in a particular build of
///    the depot (manifest IDs can be considered depot versions in that sense)
///    and the chunks they contain. That information can be used to download the
///    content they list, verify the files, and two manifests for the same depot
///    can be compared to perform an update. TEK Steam Client however prefers to
///    use the term "item" rather than "depot" to also differentiate Steam
///    Workshop items, which are all stored in the same depot, but have
///    absolutely different data.
///  Patches - created between certain successive manifests, provide LZMA or
///    Zstandard delta data that can be applied to certain source manifest
///    chunks to convert them to target manifest chunks. This saves update
///    download size due to delta chunks being much smaller than produced target
///    chunks.
