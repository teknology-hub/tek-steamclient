/// Declarations for the app manager interface, that manages state of Steam
///    applications, their DLC, and Steam Workshop items, in specified directory
///    and provides options for downloading, updating and verifying them.
/// Application manager uses (and creates if it doesn't exist) a directory
///    named `tek-sc-data` in the application directory, where it stores its
///    data, which includes:
///    - State database in the `state.sqlite3` file
///    - Zstandard-compressed depot manifest (`<item_id>_<manifest_id_hex>.zst`)
///        files in the `manifests` subdirectory.
///    - Temporary job files in `jobs/<item_id>` subdirectories:
///        - Depot patch (`patch`), verification cache (`vcache`), delta
///            (`delta`), chunk (`chunk_buf`) and transfer (`transfer_buf`)
///            buffer files.
///        - Download cache for whole files in the `img` subdirectory
///    Where `<item_id>` is `<app_id_hex>-<depot_id_hex>` for regular depots or
///    `<app_id_hex>-<depot_id_hex>-<workshop_item_id_hex>` for Steam Workshop
///    items.
