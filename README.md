tek-steamclient is an open-source C library that implements some parts of a Steam client, most notably the application manager, that allows downloading, verifying and updating Steam applications. It is written in C and C++ and can be built both for Windows and Linux.

This repository also provides tek-sc-cli, simple command-line interface on top of tek-steamclient, somewhat similar to steamcmd in functionality.

## Features

- Cross-platform
- Does *not* require Steam application to be installed, and in fact offers alternative to some of its functionality
- Can utilize [tek-s3](https://github.com/teknology-hub/tek-s3) servers to work with applications owned by other people, without logging into their accounts locally
- Is fully 64-bit, and efficiently utilizes modern OS features to achieve best I/O performance
- Uses homemade update algorithms that allow utilizing much less disk space for pathcing than Steam app does

## Installing

### Windows

There are statically linked binaries for libtek-steamclient-1.dll and tek-sc-cli.exe in [releases](https://github.com/teknology-hub/tek-steamclient/releases), in archives marked as win-x86_64-static. They do not have any external dependencies other than Windows system DLLs, and are recommended for regular use. These binaries are built in MSYS2 CLANG64 environment with some of the packages rebuilt with customized build options to enable missing features and building static libraries where they weren't being built. The binaries are signed by Nuclearist's code signing certificate, which in turn is signed by [TEK CA](https://teknology-hub.com/public-keys/ca.crt), so they will be trusted by OS if TEK CA certificate is.

### Linux

There are 2 Linux AppImage builds of tek-sc-cli in [releases](https://github.com/teknology-hub/tek-steamclient/releases), which are built in a CachyOS container and signed by Nuclearist's [GPG key](https://teknology-hub.com/public-keys/nuclearist.asc). The .full.AppImage also includes libstdc++.so and libc.so, so it can run on systems that have too old versions of those, or don't use libstdc++. Both AppImages can be run with `TEK_SC_USE_SYSTEM_LIBS=1` environment variable to prefer system libraries over bundled ones.

To use the library, you have to install a package for your distro listed below, or [build from source](https://github.com/teknology-hub/tek-steamclient/blob/main/BUILD.md) if it's not.

## Using

tek-steamclient consists of several APIs:
- Application manager (app_manager, am) - Higher level API, uses all the other ones under the hood. Manages Steam item installations in a directory, provides functions for installing, updating, verifying, uninstalling them. Recommended to use unless there is a good reason not to.
- SteamPipe API (steampipe, sp) - Focused on downloading and decoding data from SteamPipe content servers (manifests, patches, chunks).
- Content API (content, [dm, dp, vc, dd]) - provides structures and functions for parsing/creating, serializing and deserializing Steam content files in tek-steamclient's own formats: depot manifests, depot patches, verification caches, and depot deltas.
- tek-s3 client API (s3_client, s3c) - provides integration with tek-s3 servers, allowing to get their depot decryption keys and to fetch manifest request codes from them. Application manager uses it with servers synchronized via `tek_sc_s3c_sync_manifest`
- CM client API (cm) - provides client for Steam CM servers that manage account-related functionality. Application manager implicitly uses it with an anonymous account to fetch some of the data it needs.

For end users, tek-sc-cli program provides thin command-line interface for application manager and tek-s3 client APIs. Use its `--help` argument or `help` command to list available commands.

For developers, libtek-steamclient interfaces are provided via header files:
- [base.h](https://github.com/teknology-hub/tek-steamclient/blob/main/include/tek-steamclient/base.h) - Basic declarations used by all APIs and library context functions.
- [error.h](https://github.com/teknology-hub/tek-steamclient/blob/main/include/tek-steamclient/error.h) - Declarations of types and functions for error handling, used by all APIs.
- [os.h](https://github.com/teknology-hub/tek-steamclient/blob/main/include/tek-steamclient/os.h) - OS-specific type declarations used by some of the APIs.
- [cm.h](https://github.com/teknology-hub/tek-steamclient/blob/main/include/tek-steamclient/cm.h) - CM client API.
- [s3c.h](https://github.com/teknology-hub/tek-steamclient/blob/main/include/tek-steamclient/s3c.h) - tek-s3 client API.
- [content.h](https://github.com/teknology-hub/tek-steamclient/blob/main/include/tek-steamclient/content.h) - Content API.
- [sp.h](https://github.com/teknology-hub/tek-steamclient/blob/main/include/tek-steamclient/sp.h) - SteamPipe API.
- [am.h](https://github.com/teknology-hub/tek-steamclient/blob/main/include/tek-steamclient/am.h) - Application manager API.

## Project structure

- `include` - C header files providing public library interface.
- `pkgfiles` - Files or file templates for package managers to use.
- `po` - Localization files.
- `protos` - Protobuf definition files for various Steam messages. Based on data from [SteamDatabase/Protobufs](https://github.com/SteamDatabase/Protobufs) project.
- `res` - Resource files for Windows binaries
- `src` - Source code:
  + `cli` - tek-sc-cli program source code
  + `common` - headers used by both libtek-steamclient and tek-sc-cli
  + `lib` - libtek-steamclient library source code
- `subprojects` - Meson subproject directory. The repository includes wrap files and package files for dependencies that do not have their own packages in major distros. Currently the only such is [ValveFileVDF](https://github.com/TinyTinni/ValveFileVDF)
