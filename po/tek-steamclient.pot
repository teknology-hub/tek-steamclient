"You are about to sign tek-s3 server at %s into your Steam account.\n"
"What it WILL do:\n"
"- Get decryption keys (that are not present in the server's cache yet) for "
"all Steam depots that your account has access to. This is a one-time "
"operation\n"
"- Get manifest request codes for Steam depots that your account has access "
"to, on demand\n"
"That is, it will essentially allow all tek-steamclient users to download and "
"update apps owned on your account, without exposing any account information "
"to them\n"
"What it CAN do (but WON'T unless the server is maliciously modified):\n"
"- Access most of your account information\n"
"- Do most of the stuff that is not protected by Steam Guard\n"
"What it CANNOT do under any circumstances (as long as you have Steam Guard "
"enabled):\n"
"- Change your email, password, make purchases\n"
"- Gain any further access to your account after the token expires or you "
